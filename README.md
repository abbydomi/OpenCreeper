# OpenCreeper

A clone from Sludge Life's Crypt Crepper for iOS

The original repo was a class project made by
- [Diego Moreno](https://github.com/Dmoiz)
- [Osasu SÃ¡nchez](https://github.com/osasusan)
- [Abigail Dominguez](https://github.com/abbydomi)

This fork removes some features deemed unnecesary by me (abby) and builds on top of where we left the original game to make a more faithful recreation of Crypt Creeper

All the art is remade by hand and no asset is ripped from Sludge Life

Crypt Creeper and Sludge Life are games developed by Doseone and Terri Vellmann and published by Devolver Digital.
I don't own the original game idea, art or sounds in this project
This was made for fun, to prove it could be done, and with love towards the original game.
